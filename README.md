A powerful, interactive, and beautifully designed canvas for visualizing system architectures. Built with **React** and **Vite**, this tool allows you to drag, drop, and connect components to create professional-grade system diagrams directly in your browser.

## ✨ Features

-   **Extensive Component Library**: Includes 100+ pre-built icons for:
    -   **Cloud Infrastructure** (AWS, Azure, GCP icons)
    -   **Databases & Storage** (SQL, NoSQL, File Storage)
    -   **Networking** (Load Balancers, CDNs, Firewalls)
    -   **DevOps & Tools** (Docker, K8s, Git)
-   **Custom Components**: Create your own reusable components with a visual icon selector.
-   **Smart Connections**: Smooth, bezier curve connections that automatically snap to node edges.
-   **Modern UI**: Sleek, dark-themed interface with card-based property panels and a clean aesthetic.
-   **Properties Editor**: detailed sidebar for editing node and connection metadata.
